## Executive Summary

Price and Amenities:

The price and amenities analysis demonstrates that properties with premium facilities command significantly higher valuations. Listings with amenities such as gymnasiums, swimming pools, and dedicated car parking consistently exceed the citywide average price per sq. ft. of ₹13,555, often reaching ₹18,000–₹20,000 per sq. ft. Properties offering four or more key amenities tend to fall into the high-price segment, with average total prices above ₹2 crore. Interestingly, some emerging suburbs like Mira Road West and Kalyan West combine extensive amenities with competitive per sq. ft. prices around ₹9,000–₹11,000, making them attractive to budget-conscious buyers. In contrast, luxury zones like Malabar Hill and Bandra West maintain per sq. ft. rates above ₹40,000, where amenities act as a baseline expectation rather than a differentiator.
